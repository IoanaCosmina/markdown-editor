This is a markdown editor app.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I'm also using React Hooks. For the HTML parsing I'm using [React Markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown).

You can visit the GitHub project page [here](https://ioanacosmina.github.io/markdown-editor/) to test the app or just clone the repository.

## Improvement ideas
- Show word count
- Implement Download functionality
